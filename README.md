# Antidepressant Discontinuation

I am pleased to make available the codes and datasets from our research paper, "A Risk Identification Model for Detection of Patients at Risk of Antidepressant Discontinuation".

The two codes, "Descriptive_information.ipynb" and "Classification_DXD-stop_3_feature_set.ipynb", do not require a GPU for execution; they can comfortably be run on a CPU. You have the flexibility to run these codes in Google Colab or any platform of your choice.

Do remember that to gain access to all the folders, you need to execute the below command within the aforementioned codes.

```bash
!git clone https://github.com/zonour97/Antidepressant_discontinuation.git
```

I trust that this GitHub repository will prove beneficial to everyone.
